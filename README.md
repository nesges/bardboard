# bardboard

bardboard provides some simpler measures to create a browser based soundboard for sound effects and music. 

Download bardboard ("Clone or download" -&gt; "Download Zip" or checkout) and follow the instructions in "bardboard.html". non-tech savvy people might be scared by editing html but it's really not that hard. try it! :-) You can edit and test bardboard on your desktop PC. When you're done and ready, just copy the "bardboard" folder to your mobile device, point your browser to bardboard.html and you're good to go. bardboard doesn't need a webserver.

It doesn't work in Internet Explorer, but Chrome, Firefox and their derivates should be fine. I recommend [Fully](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.ozerov.fully) on Android.
