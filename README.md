# bardboard

bardboard provides some simpler measures to create a browser based soundboard for sound effects and music. copy the "bardboard" folder and follow the instructions in "bardboard.html". non-tech savvy people might be scared by editing html but it's really not that hard. try it! :-)

doesn't work in Internet Explorer. But Chrome, Firefox and their derivates should be fine. I recommend [Fully](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.ozerov.fully) on Android.

bardboard doesn't need a webserver. just copy the files over to your device, point your browser to bardboard.html and you're good to go.
