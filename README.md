# bardboard

bardboard provides some simpler measures to create a browser based soundboard for sound effects and music. copy the "bardboard" folder and follow the instructions in "bardboard.html". non-tech savvy people might be scared by editing html but it's really not that hard. try it! :-)

doesn't work in Internet Explorer. Chrome and Firefox should be fine
